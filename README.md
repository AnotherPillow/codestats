# Codestats

A program to sort your project's language amounts.

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/basicallygit/codestats.

## Downloading

1. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/anotherpillow/codestats) and rename it to `codestats.exe`
1. Put it on your path somehow.

# Usage

1. `codestats` will default to the current directory, though you can pass it a path via `codestats [PATH]`
